> This series of notes is writting to prepare MACT exam. When I read the biography from my faviorate NBA player, Derrick Rose, there is a sentece: "Use 'Why not' instead of 'Why'". These words really touched me. I am a student with biological background. But with deeper and deeper learning of the life, I gradually realized that what I am interested in is the human being. And I want to focus on how to make our life better. I want to act as a healer now. Therefore, when I know there is a chance to be a doctor with medical doctor program from a very important person, it really makes me excited.

>Biochemistry is one of the most important core course in my undergraduate school. And these notes will be writing to help me learn the biochemistry from the KAPLAN MCAT preparation book. And other related book is *Biochemistry* from PEARSON.

## 1.1 Amino Acids Found in Proteins

Amino acids are molecules that contain two functional groups: an **amino group(-NH<sub>2</sub>)** and an **carboxyl group(-COOH)**. And between them there is a carbon atom acting as a bridge to connect these two group called alpha-carbon. In addition to the amino and carboxyl groups, the alpha-carbon has two other groups attached on it: a **hydrogen** and a **side chain, or called R group**. The R group determine the properties of amino acids, and therefore their functions.

### STEREOCHEMISTRY of AMINO ACIDS

As a matter of fact, most aminoscids are optically active which means they are ahiral molecules, except **glycine**. Glycine has a hydrogen atom as its R group.

And except Cysteine, all of other amino acids have an (S) absolute configuration, which means that according to Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the prority of each group is decreased in counterclockwise direction. And only **cysteine** has (R) absolute configuration。

### STRUCTURES of the AMINO ACIDS
There are  several ways to classify amino acids. In this section, amino acids will be classified depending on the structures of their side chains.

With this classification rule, amino acids can be divied into the following parts:
- Nonpolar, Nonaromatic Side Chain 
- Aromatic Side Chains
- Polar Side Chains
- Negaticely Charged (Acidic) Side Chains
- Postively CHarger (Basic) Side Chains

#### Nonpolar, Nonaromatic Side Chain
In this class, there are seven amino acids. 

**Methioine** is one of only two amino acids that contains a sulfur atom in its side chain. However, there is a methyl group attaching on the sulfur atom, which makes it could be consider as a relative nonpolar molecule.

**Proline** is unique in that it forms a cyclic amino acid. Unlike amino group in normal amino acids,in proline, amino nitrogen atom becomes a part of side chain, forming a five-membered ring.

And other five amino acids are aliphatic amino acids, which means it has a simple side chain. **Gycine**, mentioned before, only contains hydrogen in it's side chain. **Alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine**  have alkyl side chain containing one to four carbons.

For other fundation questions, paying attention to signal words and passage structure is needed. For instance:
>##### What is the primary purpose of paragraph 3?

The **signal words** could help to locate the points. For example:

|Point Kinds|Phrases|
|:-:|-|
|main ideas|impotantly<br/> the only thing that matters is<br/> for example|  
|minor point|by the way<br/> in a few cases|
|argumant|in addiiton to<br/> therefore<br/> consequently|

Besides, **passage structure** also need to pay attention. The common sturctures are followed:

|Structure|Signal|
|:-:|:-:|
|point-counterpoint|lay out points from two sides|
|compare|commonalities and **difference**<br> like *in contrast to*, *but*, ...|
|chronological|*first*, *second*, ...|
|cause-effect|*because*. *due to*, ...|

And literary devices can also help us to understand the author's position or attitude. And there will be some questions such as
>##### An author may describe an episode in which a character sees a beautiful flower that's fighting to grow through the cracks of a grimy city sidewalk.

>##### And the question will be Which of the following is implied by the use of imagery anout the flower?

Literary device can color the author's message by using more or less pleasing examples.
