> This series of notes is writting to prepare MACT exam. When I read the biography from my faviorate NBA player, Derrick Rose, there is a sentece: "Use 'Why not' instead of 'Why'". These words really touched me. I am a student with biological background. But with deeper and deeper learning of the life, I gradually realized that what I am interested in is the human being. And I want to focus on how to make our life better. I want to act as a healer now. Therefore, when I know there is a chance to be a doctor with medical doctor program from a very important person, it really makes me excited.

>Enzymes is crucial proteins that dramatically increase th erate of biological reactions. In my opinion, the organisms could be seen as a industrial workshop. And enzymes is the basic functional elements here. With enzyme, multiple elegant manipulations are performed to construct the life.

## 2.1 Enzymes as Biological Catalysts

## 2.2 Mechanisms of Enzyme Activity
