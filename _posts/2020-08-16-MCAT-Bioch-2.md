> This series of notes is writting to prepare MACT exam. When I read the biography from my faviorate NBA player, Derrick Rose, there is a sentece: "Use 'Why not' instead of 'Why'". These words really touched me. I am a student with biological background. But with deeper and deeper learning of the life, I gradually realized that what I am interested in is the human being. And I want to focus on how to make our life better. I want to act as a healer now. Therefore, when I know there is a chance to be a doctor with medical doctor program from a very important person, it really makes me excited.

>Biochemistry is one of the most important core course in my undergraduate school. And these notes will be writing to help me learn the biochemistry from the KAPLAN MCAT preparation book. And other related book is *Biochemistry* from PEARSON.
